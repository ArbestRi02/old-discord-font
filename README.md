# Old Discord Font
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558067831791419448/1153577771910570054/image.png)

Simple CSS to revert Discord's font change back to Whitney. 

The CSS was made by Discord themselves **(I don't take any credit for the CSS)**, however I'm hosting the fonts on GitHub in order to prevent risk of them being taken off Discord's Servers.
